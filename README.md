xumoqi
======

An Android application for learning valid English words for games such as Scrabble.

This uses a Scrabble-compatible dictionary to query to match words with missing
characters.
 
Game types are:

 * Starting with blank(s): this displays words with a leading missing letter,
   represented as a blank.

 * Ending with blank(s): this displays words with a trailing missing letter.

 * Random blank(s): this displays words with a random letter missing.

For each game type, the user enters either the entire word, or only the missing letters.
Letters and words can be separated by commas and/or spaces.

This version of XuMoQi uses the Scrabble Tournament Word List (TWL), the dictionary used in Canada,
Thailand, and the United States.
